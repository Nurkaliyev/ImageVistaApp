# Image Vista Android App
I've created an Android app that will display images from the Unsplash API. To create this application I used libraries and frameworks:
- **Jetpack Compose:** To build the User Interface
- **Material 3:** To Design a beautiful and consistent UI.
- **Paging 3:** To Implement efficient and smooth infinite scrolling.
- **Coil:** To Load and display images effortlessly.
- **Dagger Hilt:** To Manage dependency injection for cleaner, modular code.
- **Compose Navigation:** To Navigate between screens seamlessly.
- **Retrofit:** To Make network requests and handle API responses.
- **Room:** To Store and manage local data.

The project was created for self-education and to consolidate the material learned.
